For hosting local repository templates it is best to store them within .github/workflows folder. Otherwise the templates
require versioning, which would only cause problems for this demonstration. Also the templates must live flat the in the
workflows folder. This is a problem for organizing pipelines. However in the real production environment a separate repository hosting all of the templates should be initialized, which shoud allow to freely organize the templates files.
For clairy in this demo the template files were prefixed with 'template-*'
